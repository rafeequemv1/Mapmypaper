              Our Mission
            </h2>
            <p>
              MapMyPaper was developed by Scidart Academy with a clear mission: to accelerate scientific research and 
              learning by transforming how researchers, academics, and students interact with complex academic content.

              Why We Built This
            </h2>
            <p>
              As researchers ourselves, we understand the challenges of processing dense academic papers efficiently. 
              Traditional methods of reading research papers can be time-consuming, leading to information overload 
              and difficulty in connecting concepts across multiple sources.
            </p>
            <p>
              We created MapMyPaper to address these pain points by leveraging the power of visual learning and AI 
              assistance to make research papers more accessible, digestible, and interconnected.
