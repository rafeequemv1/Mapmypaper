// This is a read-only file, but we need to document the fix

// The issue is in the MindMapViewer component where `MindElixir` type is used instead of `MindElixirInstance`
// Since we can't modify this file directly, we've updated the type definitions in global.d.ts
// to ensure that MindElixir includes the toJSON method that's being used.

// For reference, the fix would involve changing code like:
// const instance: MindElixir = new MindElixir({...})
// To:
// const instance: MindElixirInstance = new MindElixir({...})

// Or by ensuring that the MindElixir type definition includes all methods being used.
